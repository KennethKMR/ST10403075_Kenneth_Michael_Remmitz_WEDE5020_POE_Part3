    <p>There are a handful of people around us that have busy and stressful days, these people would be
        the prime audience of this website. On many social media platforms, there are creators who create
        videos purely for rest and relaxation purposes.These creators can range from independent creators
        to organisations that provide their viewers with that relaxation that they seek.</p>
        <img class="aboutus-image" src="Images/About-Us.jpg" width="1300" height="600">
    <p>Tranquil is a hypothetical NPO that serves the purpose of promoting these creators. These
        ASMRtists or Creators have their own little connected community, where they share their ideas
        amongst each other, but sometimes it can be a challenge for them to get their content out to the
        public, especially to the new viewers who see a video once, take interest, but are then unable to find
        the content that they just watched. </p>
    <p>Our ASMR website offers an inclusive space that fosters creativity and welcomes content creators from all walks of life.
       By encouraging a diverse range of artists and content styles,
       we promote inclusivity and ensure that individuals from various backgrounds and cultures can find ASMR content that resonates with them.
       The ability to connect with creators who share a similar cultural background or linguistic heritage can be particularly meaningful,
       fostering a sense of belonging and representation in the ASMR world.</p>
    <p>I Sincerely hope that this website will be of use to others across the globe.</p>
